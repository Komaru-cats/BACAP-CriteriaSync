Complete Collection v2.2.0
for BlazeandCave's Advancement Pack Featuring a very hard to get advancement with appropriate xp gain, and a small secret advancement for doing it twice, a reward that will confuse those not in on the joke (which I myself forgot), and a special trophy(?)



Turns out install function is unneeded, so...
this readme has little purpose
still keeping the universal install function just to troll though :barry:
(not anymore! i had to remove it in v2!)
just drag the file inside the unzip me to your world's "datapacks" folder
